# /agents/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'agents' directory a Python package.
# It typically remains empty or imports sub-packages/modules if needed
# for simplifying access, but in our case, direct imports from
# sub-packages (e.g., agents.core_agents, agents.sre_team) are used.

print("ðŸš€ Agents Package Initialized.") # Optional: confirm loading
