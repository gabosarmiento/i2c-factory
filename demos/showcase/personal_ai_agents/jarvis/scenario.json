The system should analyze communication patterns (emails, messages, calendar events) to detect brewing conflicts and relationship tensions before they escalate. Build specialized AGNO agents that work together: EmotionDetectionAgent for sentiment analysis, PatternRecognitionAgent for historical behavior analysis, InterventionStrategyAgent for personalized solution design, and CommunicationCoachAgent for message crafting. Include a FastAPI backend with endpoints for uploading communications, getting conflict predictions, and receiving intervention suggestions. Add sample data processing and real-time monitoring capabilities. The system should be proactive, not reactive - preventing problems before they happen.",
