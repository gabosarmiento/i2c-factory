      "prompt": "Create a sophisticated emotional intelligence advisor system using AGNO framework. The system should analyze communication patterns (emails, messages, calendar events) to detect brewing conflicts and relationship tensions before they escalate. Build specialized AGNO agents that work together: EmotionDetectionAgent for sentiment analysis, PatternRecognitionAgent for historical behavior analysis, InterventionStrategyAgent for personalized solution design, and CommunicationCoachAgent for message crafting. Include a FastAPI backend with endpoints for uploading communications, getting conflict predictions, and receiving intervention suggestions. Add sample data processing and real-time monitoring capabilities. The system should be proactive, not reactive - preventing problems before they happen.",
