Build specialized AGNO agents: SkillExtractionAgent that analyzes expert videos/demonstrations to identify key techniques and patterns, LearningPatternAgent that understands how humans acquire different types of skills, PersonalizationAgent that adapts teaching methods to individual learning styles and capabilities, and ARGuideAgent that provides augmented reality step-by-step guidance for real-world application. Include a Reality Debugger feature where users can point their phone camera at broken devices or processes and get instant AR overlay instructions for fixing them. Create a FastAPI backend with endpoints for uploading expert demonstrations, analyzing skill components, generating personalized learning paths, and providing AR guidance. The system should democratize access to specialized knowledge and make expert-level skills learnable by anyone.",
