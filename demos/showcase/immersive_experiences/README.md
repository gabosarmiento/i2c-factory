## Why Immersive Experiences Matter

Reality is limited by physics, but virtual reality is limited only by imagination. AI-powered immersive experiences can create impossible learning environments, therapeutic spaces, and training scenarios that adapt to individual needs.

**The Future**: Personalized realities that help humans overcome limitations, practice difficult situations safely, and experience perspectives beyond their normal lives.
