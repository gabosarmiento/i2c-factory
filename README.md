# i2c Factory — Architectural Intelligence & Self-Healing Agentic Code Evolution

> Transforming ideas into production-grade code through intelligent AI agents with autonomous reasoning, architectural understanding, self-healing capabilities, and continuous evolution loops.

---

## 🧠 What is i2c Factory?

The **i2c Factory** is an AI-powered software factory that evolves codebases using **Architectural Intelligence and Self-Healing Meta-Agent Orchestration**. It goes beyond simple code generation to understand and respect software architecture patterns while autonomously fixing issues.

Key differentiators:
* **🏗️ Architectural Intelligence** - Understands system boundaries, module responsibilities, and design patterns
* **🧠 Meta-level reasoning** that analyzes failures and adapts strategies
* **🔧 Autonomous self-healing** that automatically fixes common issues
* **🌍 Multi-language intelligence** with contextual understanding
* **📊 Comprehensive validation** through specialized agent teams
* **♻️ Iterative, validated evolution** with architectural consistency

Unlike traditional code generators, i2c Factory builds and improves software with deep understanding of why code is structured the way it is, not just how to copy patterns.

## 🏗️ Architectural Intelligence System

### 1. **ArchitectureUnderstandingAgent (The Architect)**

The factory's architectural brain that:
* **🔍 Analyzes system intent** - Understands what type of system you're building
* **🏛️ Detects architectural patterns** - Monolith, microservices, clean architecture, etc.
* **🧩 Maps module boundaries** - UI layer, API layer, business logic, data access
* **📐 Enforces structural rules** - Where files should go and why
* **🔗 Understands integration patterns** - How components should communicate

### 2. **Multi-Language Unit Test Intelligence**

Enhanced test generation that:
* **🌍 Supports 5+ languages** - Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java

## 🧠 Universal Knowledge Integration System
The i2c Factory features breakthrough Universal Knowledge Integration that transforms any documentation into actionable development patterns:

### 📚 Knowledge-Driven Development

- 🔍 Universal Document Ingestion - PDFs, markdown, APIs, any framework documentation
- 🧠 Intelligent Pattern Extraction - Automatically discovers framework patterns, conventions, and examples
- ⚡ Real-Time Knowledge Application - Agents use retrieved knowledge to generate framework-specific code
- 🎯 Context-Aware Enhancement - Agents understand and apply domain-specific patterns naturally

### 🔄 How Knowledge Integration Works

- 📖 Ingest Documentation → PDFs, guides, cheat sheets for any framework/library
- 🧩 Extract Patterns → Automatically discover imports, conventions, usage examples
- 🤖 Enhance Agents → Agents gain deep understanding of framework patterns
- 💡 Apply Knowledge → Generated code follows framework-specific patterns, not generic templates
- ✅ Validate Application → Ensure knowledge patterns are properly implemented

---

Perfect! Let's update the README to showcase the **knowledge integration capabilities** with real demos that people can test.

## Updated Getting Started Section

```markdown
## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabosarmiento/i2c-factory.git
cd i2c-factory
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here" > .env
```

### Quick Start - Knowledge-Driven Development

Test the **Universal Knowledge Integration** with our demo scenarios:

```bash
# Demo 1: AGNO-Based Task Management (Knowledge Integration)
python i2c --scenario src/i2c/demo/scenarios/agno_task_system.json

# The factory will:
# 1. Ingest AGNO documentation (PDF → Vector Database)
# 2. Extract Agent/Team patterns from docs
# 3. Generate AGNO-based code (not generic FastAPI)
# 4. Validate proper framework usage
```

### Available Demo Scenarios

Test different knowledge integration capabilities:

| Scenario | Framework | Demonstrates |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| `agno_task_system.json` | AGNO Framework | Agent/Team patterns, multi-agent coordination |
| `react_component_library.json` | React | Modern hooks, component patterns |
| `django_ecommerce.json` | Django | Model/View/Template, admin patterns |
| `spring_microservice.json` | Spring Boot | Annotations, dependency injection |
| `fastapi_ml_service.json` | FastAPI | Async patterns, ML integration |

### Test Knowledge Integration Step-by-Step

```bash
# 1. Run AGNO demo first
python i2c --scenario src/i2c/demo/scenarios/agno_task_system.json

# 2. Check generated code contains AGNO patterns
ls output/agno_task_system_*/
cat output/agno_task_system_*/backend/*.py | grep -E "Agent|Team|from agno"

# 3. Verify it's NOT generic FastAPI but true AGNO usage
# Should see: Agent classes, Team coordination, AGNO imports
```

### Advanced - Custom Knowledge Integration

```bash
# Add your own framework documentation
python i2c --scenario custom_framework.json

# Your scenario JSON should include:
# 1. Knowledge ingestion steps for your docs
# 2. Generation objectives that leverage that knowledge
# 3. Validation that patterns were applied
```

## 🧩 Knowledge Integration in Action

### Example: AGNO Framework Integration

**Input Documentation**: `src/i2c/docs/agno_guide.pdf`

**Generated Code Output**:
```python
# NOT Generic FastAPI ❌
from fastapi import FastAPI

from agno import Agent, Team

class TaskCreationAgent(Agent):
    def execute(self, task_data):
        return {"task_id": 1, "task_name": task_data["task_name"]}

class TaskRetrievalAgent(Agent):  
    def execute(self, task_id):
        return {"task_id": task_id, "task_name": "Sample Task"}

# Multi-agent coordination using AGNO Team patterns
task_management_team = Team([
    TaskCreationAgent(), 
    TaskRetrievalAgent()
])
```
